Pois using:

- light blue bean x2
- sparkfun powercell (with a little solder touch to output 3.3V)
- adafruit 8 pixelstick (because I couldn't find any proper led strip)

Inspiration:

Todo:

- experiments using strips RGB and math

- add gyroscope on both and radio for sync

- master/slave system?

- mobile app (control program variables - presets)

	- share presets

	- updates containing programs


- POV test
